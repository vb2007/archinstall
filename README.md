# Arch Linux installation guide

My way to install Arch Linux manually.
- The main installation guide is in the *1_archinstall.md* file
- The other file (*2_de_setup.md*) is just for installing a desktop environment (optional)

## Explanation

- You can copy the code blocks from the markdown files, and paste them right into the terminal (if you have ssh access or something).
- The code blocks containe shell and config commands/texts.
- If you have to add/edit/delete lines in a config file, I'll make that clear above the relevant code block,
